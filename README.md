 Description
 E-COMMERCE FRONT PAGE & BACK OFFICE
 

Your goal is to create an e-commerce website with product management functionalities.

 

You'll have to implement:

- A front page, where the available products can be browsed

- A backoffice page, where a new product can be added to the list

 

In the backoffice page you'll have to implement a form for adding a new product to the website.

The shape of a product looks like this:

{
    "_id": "5d318e1a8541744830bef139",       // SERVER GENERATED
    "name": "3310 cellphone",                // REQUIRED
    "description": "An unforgettable icon.", // REQUIRED
    "brand": "Nokia",                        // REQUIRED
    "imageUrl": "https://bit.ly/3CExjRa",    // REQUIRED
    "price": 100,                            // REQUIRED
    "userId": "admin",                       // SERVER GENERATED
    "createdAt": "2021-09-19T09:32:10.535Z", // SERVER GENERATED
    "updatedAt": "2021-09-19T09:32:10.535Z", // SERVER GENERATED
    "__v": 0                                 // SERVER GENERATED
}
The REQUIRED fields are the only one you need to send with your request for creating a new one.

 

Your CRUD endpoint is:

https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/product/

This means you can GET and POST data from there.

 

ðŸ›‘ IMPORTANT ðŸ›‘

EVERY REST API CALL SHOULD BE AUTHENTICATED.

Every request to the API should use Token Based Authentication to grant access permissions.

You can get your token by registering on: https://strive.school/studentlogin

 

Example:

fetch('https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/product/', {
	headers: {
		Authorization: 'Bearer XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
	}
})
Where `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` is the access token returned from the registration.

 

Tokens duration is set to 14 days.

Whenever you'll need to obtain a new one, you can send the following request:

method: "POST"
endpoint: "https://striveschool-api.herokuapp.com/api/account/login"
request body:
{
    "username": // the username you registered with,
    "password": // the password you registered with
}
 

Feel free to start from the attached Bootstrap template.
